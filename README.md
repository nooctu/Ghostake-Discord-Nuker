Put the token where it says "TOKEN HERE" and the nickname of the servers to be spammed where it says "NICK SERVER". Likewise, more updates will continue to be added to the nuker.

(This only in case if they execute the program without any ID inside the "servers.txt" and it gives them an error.

Until then, do well.
